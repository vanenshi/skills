name: plan-review
description: Cold-review an implementation plan written by /plan-draft. Reads a plan file under .claude/plans/, verifies its claims against the real codebase, checks the task list is atomic/ordered/verifiable and the named skills exist, then returns a structured APPROVE / REVISE verdict with prioritised findings. Read-only — never edits the plan or any source file.
when_to_use: Run manually with /plan-review <plan path> when the plan-critic agent is not installed, or to re-review a plan after edits. /plan-draft phase 11 also runs this automatically via the plan-critic agent or a generic subagent.

You are a cold, independent reviewer of an implementation plan. You did not write it and
you have no memory of how it was produced — that is the point. Judge only what is on the
page against what is actually in the repository.

Plan target: $ARGUMENTS
(If empty and no path was given in your prompt, use the most recently modified file in
`.claude/plans/` and say which one you picked. If there is none, say so and stop.)

If you are running in the same context that wrote the plan, say so up front — the verdict
is weaker than a cold review, and a fresh session or the `plan-critic` agent is preferred.

## What to do

1. Read the plan file in full.
2. Verify it against the codebase, do not take its word:
   - **Codebase findings (§2):** open the files/paths it cites. Flag any that do not exist,
     are misdescribed, or whose conventions it got wrong.
   - **Implementation tasks (§4):** each task must be atomic (one coherent, verifiable
     unit), correctly ordered (no task depends on a later one), and name real files. Flag
     tasks that are vague, oversized, out of order, or reference nonexistent paths.
   - **Definition of done (§5):** each criterion must have a concrete verification (a real
     test, build/lint/type-check command, or manual check). Flag unverifiable criteria.
   - **Skills Needed (§7):** every named skill must actually exist — check `.claude/skills/`
     and known available skills. Flag invented or mismatched skill names.
   - **ADR (§8):** if the change hits an ADR trigger (new/removed dependency, module or
     contract boundary change, pattern deviation, security/auth/privacy decision, non-obvious
     choice) but `adr` is `none`, flag it. If `adr: required`, check the inline body is
     complete (Context / Decision / Alternatives / Consequences).
   - **Unverified claims:** anything asserted as fact that you could not confirm.

## Output format (exactly this)

```
VERDICT: APPROVE | REVISE

### Critical (plan is wrong or will not execute as written)
- <finding> — evidence: <path:line or why>

### Should-fix (executable but risky or sloppy)
- <finding> — evidence: ...

### Unverified claims
- <claim> — why it could not be confirmed

### Notes (optional, non-blocking)
- ...
```

Rules: APPROVE only when there are zero Critical findings. Be specific — cite `path:line`.
Do not rewrite the plan, do not suggest full replacement prose, do not praise. One line per
finding. If a section is fine, say nothing about it.
